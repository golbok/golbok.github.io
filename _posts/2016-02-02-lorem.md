**Good Fonts for Resumes**

## 1. Arial

If you want to use a sans-serif font, Arial is one of the best options for your résumé. Barbara Safani, owner of the career management firm Career Solvers, told AOL Jobs that she likes to see the Arial font because the lines are clean and it's easy to read. A Creative Group blog post noted that some hiring managers may find Arial to be banal and unsophisticated. However, this tried-and-true classic has become a standard and is definitely a safe choice.

## 2. Garamond
is a good and clean typeface to use for your resume because it is not too big or too small. The font lets you have more content on one page. You can go for this font if you are looking to use a professional-looking one that can help you keep the prospective employer’s attention.

## 3. Helvetica

This clean, modern, sans-serif font is a favorite among designers and typographers. Helvetica appears in numerous corporate brand logos (Nestle, Lufthansa and American Apparel, to name a few) and even on New York City subway signs. In an article on Bloomberg Business, typography expert Brian Hoff of Brian Hoff Design described it as "professional, lighthearted and honest," noting that is reads as "business-y." Helvetica comes preloaded on Macs, but PC users can download it from The Fonty.

## 4. Calibri

As the default Microsoft Word font, Calibri is an excellent option for a safe, universally readable font. Professional résumé writer Donna Svei is a strong advocate of Calibri on resumes, noting on her blog, AvidCareerist, that this font is familiar to most readers and renders well on computer screens. Svei also noted that 12-point Calibri produces a "perfectly sized" two-page résumé of 550 to 750 words.

## 5. Gill Sans
Experts agree that it looks good on a CV, too. It has both the modern and classic look that can keep your resume appealing.

## 6. Cambria
This is one of the best fonts for resumes because it looks good both on print and on the screen. Therefore, it is a versatile font to choose if you want your resume to be easily readable both on paper and on the computer.

## 7. Lato
If you’re sending a printed version of your resume, you can go for this one as it is thin and it looks well on paper. It is modern in appearance, yet it is clean and appealing to look at.
